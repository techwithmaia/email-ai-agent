## Categories & Logic

Emails are classified into the following categories:

| Category          | Purpose |
|-------------------|---------|
| **Internal**       | Internal staff emails (e.g., support requests, inquiries) |
| **Customer Support** | Communication with existing customers |
| **Promotions**     | Marketing emails, newsletters |
| **Admin/Finance**  | Invoices, billing, financial updates |
| **Sales Opportunities** | Leads or business opportunities |

Each label triggers specific downstream nodes to analyze, draft, and notify accordingly.
